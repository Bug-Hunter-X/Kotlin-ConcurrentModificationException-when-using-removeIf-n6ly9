This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin related to ConcurrentModificationException when using the `removeIf` function with mutable collections. The `bug.kt` file shows the incorrect implementation which can lead to this exception. The `bugSolution.kt` file presents a correct and efficient approach to handling this issue. The example includes both `MutableList` and `MutableMap` to illustrate the issue across different collection types.  Remember to always handle mutable collection modifications carefully, especially when iterating and removing elements concurrently.
